# Banker-s-Algorithm
The banker’s algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that helps to ensure the safe allocation of resources to different processes. This algorithm helps to avoid deadlock by ensuring that a request for resources will not result in an unsafe state. In this report, we will present a multithreaded program that implements the banker’s algorithm in C.
